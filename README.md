Running Instructions:
​
To run the code locally, you need RStudio installed, along with the required libraries.
To run the code, open app.R in RStudio, and click 'Run App'.
​
If you wanted to use a different dataset besides the Atlantic / Pacific one given at the NHC website, then you need to run it through the Python script, creating a csv, before feeding that into R. To do that, you need python installed, with the required libraries.
To run the python script in the command line, type:  python hurricanes_data_cleaning.py  and provide the correct txt dataset.
Note: please make sure any filenames are changed in R to accomodate this.
​
The app is meant to visualize and anaylize hurricane data from https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat
